# Investigating the performance of gradient descent algorithms in reaching the minimum of a function

In this project: https://github.com/AliRezaKhatibi/Gradient-Descent-Algorithms/blob/26a1dd7bdaab98a52764b0875c145d3d0f3ea040/p_t_4.ipynb , the performance of gradient descent algorithms:
 Classic - Adam - Adagard - Momentum-Mini-Batch Gradient Descent-
To find the minimum of a function, it is examined and displayed
