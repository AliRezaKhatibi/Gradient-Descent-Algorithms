# Investigating the performance of gradient descent algorithms in reaching the minimum of a function
In this project: https://github.com/AliRezaKhatibi/Gradient-Descent-Algorithms/blob/c69efef6fc782a2d37940ceee9ef6f3cdbd976cb/p_t_4.ipynb  the performance of gradient descent algorithms:
Classic - Adam - Adagard - Momentum-Mini-Batch Gradient Descent-
To find the minimum of a function, it is examined and displayed
