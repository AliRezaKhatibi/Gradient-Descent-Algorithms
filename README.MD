# Investigating the performance of gradient descent algorithms in reaching the minimum of a function

In this project https://github.com/AliRezaKhatibi/Gradient-Descent-Algorithms/blob/c44ca48e18ca7861210ad20d1e6c2b16e072fefc/p_t_4.ipynb, the performance of gradient descent algorithms:
 Classic - Adam - Adagard - Momentum-Mini-Batch Gradient Descent-
To find the minimum of a function, it is examined and displayed
